Feature: Configuring endpoint

Scenario: An error report is sent successfully using the legacy endpoint
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint
  And I set environment variable "APP_VERSION" to "1.2.3"
  When I configure with the "legacy endpoint" configuration and send an error
  And I wait for 1 second
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request used payload v4 headers
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
